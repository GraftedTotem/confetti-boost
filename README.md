# Confetti Boost
A little web cheerleader—click a button, get confetti and a "You made this!" shoutout. Built to kick ADHD slump in the ass during Codecademy’s full-stack grind.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone <https://github.com/GraftedTotem/confetti-boost>`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Click "Click Me"—boom, confetti party!

## Why It Exists
Made it to feel like a win when coding gets tough. HTML, CSS, JS—small but mighty.

## Next Up
Trumpet fanfare???
